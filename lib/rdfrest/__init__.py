"""RDF-REST is a framework for building applications that

* expose their functionalities in a RESTful way, and/or
* use RESTful services.

For a high-level descripription, refer to [Champin2013]_.

RDF-REST provides a python abstraction of REST resources,
so that client code can handle and mix local and remote resources
in a completely transparent way.

In a nutshell, a RESTful application is made of a set of *resources*, which:

* are identified by a URI,
* expose a uniform interface,
* have an internal state that can be serialized in one or different formats,
* link to each other.

More precisely, in RDF-REST:

* the uniform interface of resources is defined by :class:`.cores.ICore`;
* RDF is used as a unifying model to represent resource's states (with the
  RDFLib_ library);
* :mod:`.serializers` and :mod:`.parsers` provide an extensible framework for
  supporting multiple formats.
